  <h2> Lyrics  </h2>
  
<p> Baby, can't you see I'm calling? <br>
A guy like you should wear a warning <br>
It's dangerous, I'm falling<br>
<br>
There's no escape, I can't wait<br>
I need a hit, baby, give me it<br>
You're dangerous, I'm loving it<br>
<br>
Too high, can't come down<br>
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round<br>
Do you feel me now?<br>
<br>
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride<br>
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under<br>
With a taste of a poison paradise<br>
I'm addicted to you<br>
Don't you know that you're toxic?<br>
And I love what you do<br>
Don't you know that you're toxic?<br>
<br>
It's getting late to give you up<br>
I took a sip from my devil's cup<br>
Slowly, it's taking over me<br>
<br>
Too high, can't come down<br>
It's in the air and it's all around<br>
Can you feel me now?<br>
<br>
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride<br>
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under<br>
With a taste of a poison paradise<br>
I'm addicted to you<br>
Don't you know that you're toxic?<br>
And I love what you do<br>
Don't you know that you're toxic?<br>
Don't you know that you're toxic?<br>
<br>
Taste of your lips, I'm on a ride<br>
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under<br>
With a taste of a poison paradise<br>
I'm addicted to you<br>
Don't you know that you're toxic?<br>
<br>
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride<br>
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under (toxic)<br>
With a taste of a poison paradise<br>
I'm addicted to you<br>
Don't you know that you're toxic?<br>
<br>
Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now<br>
I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now<br>
Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now<br>
I think I'm ready now</p>
